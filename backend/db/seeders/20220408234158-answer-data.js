The devs of No Mans Sky straight up cut 70% of the features out of the game and straight up lied to it consumer base.

Once you have a desired spending limit simply begin to see how much parts cost. And once you think you have it all figured out… you go to a prebuilt pc store such as desert storm where they build it for you. Seriously, if you don't have time to figure it out and expected a guide on the internet to help you build a pc, without you actually trying it for yourself, because you have  always have been blessed with the simplicity of consoles, then go where they do all the hard stuff and buy “a console” you will have the best thing within your budget with 0% of the work. Ideal for those who know nothing and DONT have time to do something about it."
